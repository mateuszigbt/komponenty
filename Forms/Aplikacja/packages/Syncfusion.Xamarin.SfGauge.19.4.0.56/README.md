## CircularGauge
The Xamarin Circular Gauge, also known as Radial Gauge is a data visualization component that helps display numerical values on a circular scale. It has highly customizable features, such as scales, pointers, ranges, and annotations. It also offers creation of speedometer, temperature monitor, dashboard, meter gauge, multi-axis clock, modern activity gauge, direction compass, etc.

### Key features

* Scales: Circular gauge scale contains labels, tick marks, and a rim to customize its basic look and feel. It defines the start angle, sweep direction, sweep angle, overall minimum and maximum values, the frequency of labels, and tick marks.
* Ranges: Range is a visual element that depicts the start and end values of inner divisions within the scale’s range. Each scale is capable of displaying one or more ranges, and each range can depict different zones or regions of same metrics, such as high, low, and average temperatures.
* Pointers: Pointer is an element that points out the values of the bound property on a scale. A circular scale will have one or more pointers that can be used to measure different values. Each pointer has the Value property, which informs the current value to the user visually.
* Headers: Header can be used to set a unique header for the circular gauge. The user can add text as the header in a circular gauge.
* Annotations: Annotations allows you to mark the specific area of interest in a circular gauge. You can place custom views, text, and images as annotations by using the annotations feature.

## LinearGauge

The Xamarin Linear Gauge is a data visualization component that helps display numerical values on a linear scale. It has highly customizable features such as scales, pointers, ranges, and annotations. Also, it offers creation of value indicator, pressure gauge, thermometer, ruler, progress bar, KPI, and more.

### Key features

* Scales: Supports to adding multiple scales on linear gauge by horizontal and vertical orientations.
* Pointers: Supports to add multiple pointers (bar and symbol) on the linear scale.
* Range: Highlights the desired range of values in the gauge scale.
* Annotations: Annotations are used to mark the specific area of interest in the gauge area with texts, shapes, or images. You can add any number of annotations to the gauge.

## DigitalGauge

The Xamarin Digital Gauge control is a data visualization component that displays alphanumeric characters to appear digital. It can display a range of values, including both characters and numbers.

### Key features

* 7-segment display - This type of digital gauge displays digital characters in 7 segments. It is mainly used to display numbers.
* 14-segment display - This type of digital gauge displays digital characters in 14 segments. It is mainly used to display both the numbers and alphabet.
* 16-segment display - This type of digital gauge displays digital characters in 16 segments. It is also mainly used to display both the numbers and alphabet.
* 8 * 8 dot matrix display - This type of digital gauge displays digital characters in 8*8 dot matrix segments, in which the characters are spotted by the regular brush and the remaining dots are spotted by the dimmed brush. It is mainly used to display numbers, characters, and special characters.

**Note:** This package needs to be installed in all Xamarin.Forms projects (PCL/.NET Standard, Android, iOS, and UWP).
